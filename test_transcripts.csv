Once there, I love indulging in the seafood cuisine, especially freshly-caught fish grill to perfection and serve with tropical fruit and spices.

After I get off, I feel very gross and just jet-lagged, but it's all worth it because in the end, I get to see and experience and try many different foods. I get to live for a few days in a completely different culture and experience a new language. My favorite food that I had there was probably the curry udon. It's something that you can find in America, but it's just special, I think, in Japan. They're using the freshest ingredients. The sushi there is really great as well. It's great to visit in the springtime when you can see the cherry blossoms bloom."

But it is softened by a few of the nicer play areas for the kids. Jungle gym here, hopscotch, chopped on the ground over there. And it might be a little bit old-fashioned, but the kids are going to figure out a way to play if they have to be outside. They'd be tossing balls at each other, perhaps making up games. Some of them would be eating their lunch. Some of them would be the older ones, especially gossiping in the corners or trying to get something done away from wherever the teachers might be looking out at them. I think that the overall sound background noise would just be shouting laughter yelling here and there."

Outdoor recreation activities during school research can contribute to a child's recommended physical activity participation. This page may occur in the playground and children might tell on each other which is a cause of concern for teachers and children. The school playground can promote physical activity for large number of children. Overall the school playground is a crucial setting."

So every travel that we got to spend with each other, I also saw in the airport many families who are excited for their trips, who are excited to make memories in other countries. And all I can see is that they are love. They are loving and that's what I see in an airport. Although it is technically during planes with the technologies that are there, what I really love with the airport is the families that are in the scene and are spending time with each other."
audio_122," The best day of my life is my husband and I's second wedding day. It was a COVID wedding and very, very small, but it was special because our closest family members were finally able to witness us make vows to each other. It was a day of joy and it makes me very happy to think that we were able to do that and celebrate us and our new family with the people that we love the most."
audio_61_1," My favorite hobby is doing yoga. I enjoy the fact that it's very peaceful and it allows you to meditate for a while, also that your body feels really good afterwards, like you just had a massage. You need a mat to practice this hobby, and I enjoy practicing it with other people in outdoor classes or indoor classes. I usually do it in the evenings because it's easier for me and I'm free at that time. It's really good for your health and it's good for when you're older and all your joints hurt. It's trying to prevent your bones and your joints hurting during your 50s or 60s."

audio_72," My role model is my grandmother. So I'm actually a product of a broken family. So when I was actually about two months old, my mom left me. And at the same time, my father built a new family as well. So it's kind of like a sad story in my end. However, on seeing a positive side of life, of course, I'm actually seeing always my grandmother's role model. So she's actually someone that I would like to imitate. We're seeing of having this perspective of being positive that if ever at the end of the day, she will always support and give you values."
audio_107," This goal is important to me because initially I wanted to become a banker, but as I realized I cannot become a banker, the utmost pinnacle of human achievement that I believe I was onto to is being an architect and building nice buildings. The challenges that I'm facing are avoiding becoming an engineer at all costs as engineers only support architects, architects, art that remembers and the creators of wonderful buildings. The fear of failing in my pursuit to become an architect and becoming an engineer instead motivates me to stay focused and determined on the path to achieving my goal."
audio_15," The market is crowded. There are a lot of people, different peoples. There are foreigners, there are locals, there are professionals, there are just simple people. You smell a lot of things, fish, meat, vegetables, there are a lot. You're also able to see that there are a lot of products, local products. There are a lot of things that, or there are a lot of products that you could choose from. As a card market, a lot of noise are in there. So if you are not good at noises, it is not for you. But the card market is great."
audio_93," My favorite place to visit is a warm sunny beach. I love hearing the oceans crash. I love the smell of the ocean. I love running my fingers to the sand. The best time to go. Sunrise, sundown are both really good times to go. But in general, you can go at all times. Even at night, even though the ocean gets a bit scary, it's still peaceful. You can calm being next to a big body of water like the ocean. So I would definitely say go to the beach."

audio_103," My daily routine starts with waking up in the morning and then I prepare my breakfast. So after I ate a little, I take a bath and then prepare my clothes. So once I put in my clothes or talk in my clothes, I go to my motorcycle and then I wear a helmet and then I drive my motorcycle into the work. And then after my energetic work, within that day I go back home and I play with my hobbies, which is playing online games and then I go sleep and I repeat the same routine again."
